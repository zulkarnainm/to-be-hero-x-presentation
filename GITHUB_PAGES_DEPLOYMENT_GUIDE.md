6. **Wait 2-5 minutes** for deployment to complete

### Step 5: Access Your Live Site
Your site will be available at:

```

**Example:** If your GitHub username is `johndoe`, your URL will be:
`https://johndoe.github.io/to-be-hero-x-presentation/`

```

## 🎯 What Your Live Site Will Feature
- ✅ Vue.js-powered interactive presentation
- ✅ Tailwind CSS modern styling
- ✅ Frosted glass navbar with show colors
- ✅ Bug-free hero filtering system
- ✅ Episode carousel with smooth transitions
- ✅ Chinese names with Pinyin
- ✅ Gradient effects and creative design
- ✅ All hero images properly displayed
- ✅ Fully responsive (mobile/desktop)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **404 Error:** Make sure your main file is named `index.html`
- **Images not loading:** Verify `imgs/` folder is in repository root
- **CSS/JS not working:** Check if CDN links are accessible (Vue.js and Tailwind CSS)
- **Changes not reflecting:** GitHub Pages can take 5-10 minutes to update

### If GitHub Pages isn't enabled:
1. Repository must be **public** (private repos need GitHub Pro)
2. Go to Settings → Pages and ensure source is set to `main` branch

## 🎨 Customizing Your URL (Optional)
If you want a custom domain:
1. **Buy a domain** (like `yourname.com`)
2. **In repository Settings → Pages → Custom domain**
3. **Add your domain and configure DNS**

## 📱 Testing Your Deployed Site
After deployment, test these features:
1. **Navigation tabs:** Smooth transitions between sections
2. **Hero filtering:** "All Heroes" → "Top 3" → "All Heroes" (fixed bug!)
3. **Episode carousel:** Should slide through episodes
4. **Mobile responsiveness:** Test on different screen sizes
5. **Chinese names:** Check Pinyin displays correctly
6. **Quiz functionality:** Interactive elements work properly

## 🎉 Ready to Share!
Once deployed, your GitHub Pages URL is ready to share with:
- Fellow anime fans
- Friends and family
- Social media
- Any To Be Hero X communities

## 📈 Optional: Track Visitors
Add Google Analytics to your `index.html` if you want to see how many people visit your presentation.
